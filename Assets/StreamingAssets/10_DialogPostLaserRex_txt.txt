[BLEEP] Jurassic? More like jer-butt-kicked!
[BLOOP] Look at all this bitcoin!
[BLEEP] How much is it worth?
[BLOOP] It's worth one million... oh wait no it's worth nothing
[REX]   Thank you so much! You've saved me! I was brainwashed by that evil helmet
[BLOOP] Brainwashed?
[BLEEP] Who would do such a thing?
[AJIT] 	Mwahahaha! It is I, Bobby Badguy, CEO of Whactivision (TM)!
[BLOOP] I knew he was a corporate puppet, but this is ridiculous!
[BLEEP] Look! He has teeth! he must be super rich!
[AJIT]  Yes and it's all because of my plan to exploit game developers!
[AJIT] 	But you can't tell anyone, because you signed an NDA!
[BLEEP] N-D-Heeeeyyyyy wait a second! That's some fresh hot biscuits!
[AJIT] 	Biscuits aside, if I can't destroy the game industry, then I'll destroy the world!
[AJIT] 	Behold my final form:
[AJIT] 	the capitalist calamity...
[AJIT] 	the money meteor...
[AJIT] 	the fiscal fireball!!
